The DApp I have developed involves a Solidity smart contract that directly transfers assets from the testator's account into the inheritors' as soon as an authorized Death Certificate issuer issues a certificate into the network. Before the testator's demise, the funds and the list of inheritors are completely under his/her control and he can modify it at will. He/she may deposit/withdraw funds at will and decide on how much of his wealth shall go to each of his inheritors. After his demise, there will no longer be any need for verification as the funds have been deposited into the smart contract.

The App is called Succession. At the Homepage, we may connect to a wallet like MetaMask and then proceed with the following functionalities:
1) Add Inheritor
2) Deposit Funds
3) Modify Inheritor
4) Withdraw Funds
5) Check Balance
6) Issue Death Certificate
7) View Inheritors list and shares
